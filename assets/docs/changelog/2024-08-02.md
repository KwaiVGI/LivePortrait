🎉 We are excited to announce the release of a new version featuring animals mode, along with several other updates. Special thanks to the dedicated efforts of the LivePortrait team. 💪

### Updates on Animals mode
We are pleased to announce the release of the animals mode, which is fine-tuned on approximately 230K frames of various animals (mostly cats and dogs). The trained weights have been updated in the `liveportrait_animals` subdirectory, available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait/tree/main/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UtKgzKjFAOmZkhNK-OYT0caJ_w2XAnib). You should [download the weights](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait?tab=readme-ov-file#2-download-pretrained-weights) before running. There are two ways to run this mode.

> Please note that we have not trained the stitching and retargeting modules for the animals model due to several technical issues. This may be addressed in future updates. Therefore, we recommend using the `--no_flag_stitching` option when running the model.

Before launching, ensure you have installed `transformers==4.22.0`, `pillow>=10.2.0`, which are already updated in  [`requirements_base.txt`](../../../requirements_base.txt). We have chosen [XPose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/X-Pose) as the keypoints detector for animals. This relies on `transformers` and requires building an OP named `MultiScaleDeformableAttention` by
```bash
cd src/utils/dependencies/XPose/models/UniPose/ops
python setup.py build install
cd - # equal to cd ../../../../../../../
```

You can run the model using the script `inference_animals.py`:
```bash
python inference_animals.py -s assets/examples/source/s39.jpg -d assets/examples/driving/wink.pkl --no_flag_stitching --driving_multiplier 1.75
```

Alternatively, we recommend using Gradio. Simply launch it by running:
```bash
python app_animals.py # --server_port 8889 --server_name "0.0.0.0" --share
```

> [!WARNING]
> [XPose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/X-Pose) is only for Non-commercial Scientific Research Purposes, you should remove and replace it with other detectors if you use it for commercial purposes.

### Updates on Humans Mode

- **Driving Options**: We have introduced an `expression-friendly` driving option to **reduce head wobbling**, now set as the default. While it may be less effective with large head poses, you can also select the `pose-friendly` option, which is the same as the previous version. This can be set using `--driving_option` or selected in the Gradio interface. Additionally, we added a `--driving_multiplier` option to adjust driving intensity, with a default value of 1, which can also be set in the Gradio interface.

- **Retargeting Video in Gradio**: We have implemented a video retargeting feature. You can specify a `target lip-open ratio` to adjust the mouth movement in the source video. For instance, setting it to 0 will close the mouth in the source video 🤐.

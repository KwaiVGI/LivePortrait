üéâ We are excited to announce the release of a new version featuring animals mode, along with several other updates. Special thanks to the dedicated efforts of the LivePortrait team. üí™ We also provided an one-click installer for Windows users, checkout the details [here](./2024-08-05.md).

### Updates on Animals mode
We are pleased to announce the release of the animals mode, which is fine-tuned on approximately 230K frames of various animals (mostly cats and dogs). The trained weights have been updated in the `liveportrait_animals` subdirectory, available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait/tree/main/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UtKgzKjFAOmZkhNK-OYT0caJ_w2XAnib). You should [download the weights](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait?tab=readme-ov-file#2-download-pretrained-weights) before running. There are two ways to run this mode.

> Please note that we have not trained the stitching and retargeting modules for the animals model due to several technical issues. _This may be addressed in future updates._ Therefore, we recommend **disabling stitching by setting the `--no_flag_stitching`** option when running the model. Additionally, `paste-back` is also not recommended.

#### Install X-Pose
We have chosen [X-Pose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/X-Pose) as the keypoints detector for animals. This relies on `transformers==4.22.0` and `pillow>=10.2.0` (which are already updated in `requirements.txt`) and requires building an OP named `MultiScaleDeformableAttention`.

Refer to the [PyTorch installation](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait?tab=readme-ov-file#for-linux-or-windows-users) for Linux and Windows users.


Next, build the OP `MultiScaleDeformableAttention` by running:
```bash
cd src/utils/dependencies/XPose/models/UniPose/ops
python setup.py build install
cd - # this returns to the previous directory
```

To run the model, use the `inference_animals.py` script:
```bash
python inference_animals.py -s assets/examples/source/s39.jpg -d assets/examples/driving/wink.pkl --no_flag_stitching --driving_multiplier 1.75
```

Alternatively, you can use Gradio for a more user-friendly interface. Launch it with:
```bash
python app_animals.py # --server_port 8889 --server_name "0.0.0.0" --share
```

> [!WARNING]
> [X-Pose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/X-Pose) is only for Non-commercial Scientific Research Purposes, you should remove and replace it with other detectors if you use it for commercial purposes.

### Updates on Humans mode

- **Driving Options**: We have introduced an `expression-friendly` driving option to **reduce head wobbling**, now set as the default. While it may be less effective with large head poses, you can also select the `pose-friendly` option, which is the same as the previous version. This can be set using `--driving_option` or selected in the Gradio interface. Additionally, we added a `--driving_multiplier` option to adjust driving intensity, with a default value of 1, which can also be set in the Gradio interface.

- **Retargeting Video in Gradio**: We have implemented a video retargeting feature. You can specify a `target lip-open ratio` to adjust the mouth movement in the source video. For instance, setting it to 0 will close the mouth in the source video ü§ê.

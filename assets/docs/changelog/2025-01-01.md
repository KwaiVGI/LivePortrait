We’re thrilled that cats are now serenading the internet! 🎶

In this update, we’ve improved the [Animals model](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait/tree/main/liveportrait_animals/base_models_v1.1) with more data. While you might notice only a slight improvement for cats (if at all 😼), dogs have gotten a slightly better upgrade. For example, the model is now better at recognizing their mouths instead of mistaking them for noses. 🐶

The new version (v1.1) Animals Model has been updated on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait/tree/main/liveportrait_animals/base_models_v1.1). The new version is enabled by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: Make sure to update your weights to use the new version.

If you prefer to use the original version, simply modify the configuration in [inference_config.py](../src/config/inference_config.py)
```python
version_animals = "" # old version
# version_animals = "_v1.1" # new (v1.1) version
```
